# MarkovianDungeonGenerator
Creates a random dungeon using a Markov Chain

Generation only takes the previous tile into account when generating dungeon. Ideally, it should take the previous and the above
tile to determine the next tile.

A node based implementation of a markov chain may be better instead of my confusing switch-case statement.

More improvements to make the dungeon be fully connected, add treasure and enemies, ...
